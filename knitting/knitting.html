    <ol class="list">
      <li>
        It is very important to understand that the bigger the hook, the larger the stitches will be, which also means there will be a better drape in a garment.
        But this also means that your garment may look like it has mesh or holes. If you use the appropriate hook size for the yarn,
        your garment will look more standard with regular stitches.
      </li>
      <li>
        Learn to tension correctly. You don't have to follow exactly how others hold their yarn and hook.
        Every person has different preferences, so what someone else is doing may not work for you.
      </li>
      <li>
        Don't make your beanie too long. To measure for a beanie, measure from the top middle of your head to your forehead.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you are a little more comfortable with your amigurumi skills, try doing yarn under instead of yarn over to make tighter stitches.
        When you make rounds in amigurumi without making a slip stitch at the end of every round, you will start making a spiral which makes your stitches uneven and they will not align from the stitch above.
