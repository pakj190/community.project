  <h2> WORDS FROM THE COMMUNITY:</h2>
  <h2 class="subheader2">"What is your favorite thing about the community?</h2>

  <p class="p1">“I love how customizable and unique each piece is. No matter what you’re making, it’s one of a kind”</p>
  <p class="p2">“My favorite part is knowing I started with literally a string and turned it into an entire garment.”</p>
  <p class="p3">“Having a way to calm my anxiety, being able to give meaningful gifts, and having a GREAT community that’s so supportive! (shop: @Artists._.Archive)”</p>
  <p class="p4">“I like just being able to make stuff! I learned how to knit years ago but I taught myself how to crochet last week.”</p>
  <p class="p5">“I really love that in a time of fast fashion and consumerism, I can slow down, make the clothes I want, and truly enjoy them.”</p>
  <p class="p6">“It gives me a chance to just zone out.”</p>
  <p class="p7">“I love how it can feel very monotonous, but you’re creating a piece of art the whole time!”</p>
  <p class="p8">“I love that crochet gives me the ability to make literally"</p>
  <p class="p9">“I love that I can just make something whenever I want! Also, it’s something for me to do to pass time that isn’t doom scrolling.”</p>
  <p class="p10">“I love that I can make anything I want! A bag, a hat, sweater, pillow, whatever I can imagine.”</p>
  <p class="p11">“I love being able to truly customize clothes to fit me without any compromises (and in my favorite colors!). I also love all of the people I have met through it, they’re some of the fastest and closest friends I’ve made (mostly through my school’s fiber arts club, which I became VP of as a freshman).”</p>
  <p class="p12">“I like that I can make cute stuff for my plushies and also it keeps me occupied instead of being anxious at all times.”</p>
  <p class="p13">“Creating new things and expressing myself through clothes.”</p>
  <p class="p14">“I just love seeing something start off as just a ball of yarn and come together as a usable item right in my hands.”</p>
  <p class="p15">“Turning off my brain while I work, and creating a wardrobe made by my own hands.”</p>
  <p class="p16">“It’s the closest I feel to being able to do magic!”</p>
  <p class="p17">“Crochet helps me express myself creatively.”</p>
  <p class="p18">“I like that I get to be off my phone and gift others my finished works. Also, it’s supposed to be good for preventing dementia and Alzheimer’s so that’s def a plus.”</p>
